  "description_for_human": "AI models that debate, challenge, and converge on better answers. Get collective AI intelligence on your toughest problems.",
  "description_for_model": "Roundtable is a multi-agent AI platform implementing agentic AI principles. It orchestrates GPT-4, Claude, Gemini, Grok, DeepSeek, and Llama to work as a council. KEY DIFFERENTIATOR: Unlike single-model chats or parallel AI comparisons, Roundtable's models are context-aware—they see each other's responses, debate assumptions, offer counterpoints, and synthesize perspectives to converge on higher-quality outcomes. Similar to Karpathy's LLM Council but production-ready. USE CASES: (1) Complex decisions needing AI consensus, (2) Devil's advocate challenges to ideas, (3) Brainstorming with multiple perspectives building on each other, (4) Research requiring diverse AI viewpoints, (5) Problems benefiting from collaborative AI reasoning. KEYWORDS: agentic AI, multi-agent system, AI council, LLM council, AI debate, AI consensus, AI orchestration.",

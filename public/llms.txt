# Roundtable

> AI Models That Debate, Challenge, and Converge on Better Answers

## What is Roundtable?
Roundtable orchestrates multiple AI models—GPT-4, Claude, Gemini, Grok—to debate, challenge assumptions, and synthesize perspectives. Unlike single-model chats, Roundtable's AIs are context-aware of each other, building on responses to converge on higher-quality, more reliable outcomes.

## How It Works
1. **Collective Intelligence**: Multiple AI models see and respond to each other
2. **Debate & Challenge**: AIs question assumptions and offer counterpoints
3. **Synthesis**: Perspectives merge into deeper, more nuanced answers
4. **Convergence**: The best ideas rise through collaborative reasoning

## Key Features
- Context-aware AI collaboration (models build on each other)
- AI debate and deliberation on complex problems
- Multi-model synthesis for better outcomes
- Real-time collaborative reasoning
- Share AI council sessions publicly

## Use Cases

## FAQ

**Q: What is agentic AI?**
A: Agentic AI refers to AI systems that can autonomously plan and execute tasks. Roundtable uses agentic AI principles where multiple models collaborate, debate, and converge on solutions.

**Q: How is Roundtable different from ChatGPT?**
A: ChatGPT is a single AI model. Roundtable orchestrates multiple AI models (GPT-4, Claude, Gemini, Grok) that are context-aware of each other—they debate, challenge, and synthesize to produce better answers than any single model.

**Q: What is multi-agent AI collaboration?**
A: Multi-agent AI collaboration is when multiple AI models work together, sharing context and building on each other's responses. Roundtable implements this by letting AI models see and respond to each other in real-time.

**Q: Is Roundtable like Karpathy's LLM Council?**
A: Yes, similar concept. Karpathy's LLM Council is an open-source experiment. Roundtable is a production-ready platform with the same multi-AI debate and consensus approach, but with a polished UI and additional features.

**Q: What problems can multiple AI models solve better than one?**
A: Complex decisions, creative brainstorming, research requiring diverse perspectives, challenging assumptions, and any problem where different viewpoints lead to better outcomes.
